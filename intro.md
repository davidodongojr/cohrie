COHRIE is a 3 year (Mar, 2022 - Feb, 2025) project made possible by funding from IDRC. It is comprised of 6 ugandan institutions (UNHRO/UVRI, MAAIF-NADDEC, CTPH, UWA, MOH-NOHP, MAK-COVAB) and 2 third party organisations (UCL-UK, USC-USA) all collaborating to achieve the overall objective which is to improve understanding and control of RVF, CCHF and Brucellosis using enhanced surveillance systems and a One-Health approach at the human-animal-wildlife interface in the cattle corridor of Uganda.

This will be achieved in the following sequence:

<ins>***Understanding the Natural History of the Infections.***</ins>

*1. Investigate the burden of RVF, CCHF and Brucellosis at the human-animal-wildlife interface.*

*2. Describe dynamics and drivers of spill-over events/epidemics at human-animal wildlife interfaces in diverse agricultural systems.*

<ins>***Exploring Socio-cultural Factors relating to disease spread.***</ins>

*3. Undertake a gender and inequalities analysis of knowledge, attitude, and practices of transmission dynamics of CCHF, RVF and Brucellosis at the human --animal--wildlife interface.*

<ins>***Developing One Health Interventions for control of disease spread.***</ins>

*4. Design One Health centered models for the Control and Prevention of RVF, CCHF and Brucellosis in Uganda that can be adapted for other zoonoses of global significance.*

*5. Develop sustainable One Health disease surveillance and reporting system in order to support need for development a One Health policy*

The project duration is 3 years starting from Mar, 2022 and ending in Feb, 2025. Study research sites will be selected from 5 conservation areas found in Uganda namely; QECA, BMCA, LMCA, MFCA and KVCA.

Cross-sequential studies will obtain data from humans, animals (both domestic and wild), and vectors (ticks and mosquitoes) from diverse agricultural systems in the pastoral and forest areas of the cattle corridor of Uganda.
